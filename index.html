            <p>Welcome to my DCDA Capstone Portfolio. Here I will show the work I will create this semester.  </p>

            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> [My name is Zoe-Kylie Sanchez, I am a DCDA major and Writing minor]</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> [I am passionate about media analysis,and that is what drew me to DCDA. Some of my iterest include art history, and literature. I first started as an English major, and what first drew me to this major was its ability to combine the humanities with technology. By combining these two fields, a student is allowed to develop both soft, and hard skills, such as coding, and critical thinking.]</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> [I hope to become more confident in my coding skill, while also practicing good design.]</p>

<!--Lab One was largely a refresher on HTML and CSS. I have worked with these forms of code before, as they are basic design languages, and I have used them in previous classes such as Digital Creative Writing. GitHub is also something I have used in the past, but I am glad to have the opportunity to work with it again, since it has been a while since I last used it. This lab was not particularly difficult for me once I had GitHub and Visual Studio set up on my laptop. I am excited to continue developing my portfolio and to add more visuals that support the research I will conduct later in this class.-->
