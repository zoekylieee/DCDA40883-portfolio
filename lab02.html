            <h2>What I Tried</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is a Large Language Model that can only spit out information that it already knows, it is not able to create its own thoughts.
I also used perplexity which was another LLM that produced similar responses but provided longer suggestions.
I gave perplexity the exact same instructions in the exact sequence as I did ChatGPT.
I asked ChatGPT to give me a list of groceries and it focused on making a well rounded grocery list, but I then asked it to make a list of grocery items specific to Trader Joes and to keep specific meals in mind: this led to a more detailed list that is more organized.
I then asked chatgpt to make a list with those previous requirements but to minimize the items and give me a grocery list that can make multiple meals.</p>

            <h2>What Happened</h2>
            <p>Instead it uses your words as tokens and can only make sense of them in that way.
While playing around with ChatGPT I realized that it’s strengths lie in making sentences concise and shorter, it won’t necessarily create the most outstanding original prose but it is good at keeping things direct.
I also noticed that you have to be very specific with what you are asking it to do.
Giving ChatGPT clear instructions will allow it to give you the results you truly want.
This was a great idea and helped me conceptualize new meals with the same grocery items.
The first response gave me similar categories for a grocery list, but added a new section such as home necessities, and there was similar suggestions to the ones of ChatGPT.
When I asked perplexity to create a Trader Joes list with specific meals in mind it created a list of the ingredients and then gave me specific meals with instructions on how to make the meal Perplexity did have some features that ChatGPT did not such as, Perplexity finance which is a space that I did not use, but would be helpful in other scenarios. Other sections of perplexity act more like a news outlets, where you can explore different topics. A section that I explored a bit was the Arts and Culture section. If you click on a topic it then takes you to a page that has excerpts of different outlets and you can then click on those to further explore. .</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Both platforms were fairly similar but the way they organized its suggestions were slightly different.
Chat GPT also added emojis and had more of a personality compared to perplexity.</p>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>After this excercise, I realized that there are many ways that one might use AI. There are some mundane tasks that AI may help in, such as creating a grocery list. However, AI usage becomes an issue when you are not checking the information it is giving you. In my example, Perplexity added items to my grocery list that I didn't really want there, and this is a minor suggestion, but this could lead to the spread of misinformation at a bigger scale.</p>
