            <h2> Data Preparation </h2>
            <p>I did not have much trouble collecting the data. I went through a few of the sources provided, and ultimately decided to pick one relating to an art collection. I ended up choosing a public .csv of the Washington Art State Collection. This particular dataset was interesting to me, because I am currently interning at a museum. Working with this dataset allowed me to explore how data visualization techniques could be applied to areas such as collection management. The data preparation process was quite straightforward, since the Washington Art State Collection uses clean and simple categories.

            <h2> Design Choices </h2>
            <p>I initially started with creating a categorical view of my data. I first made a heat map that showed the art types throughout decades, and I initially liked this map, because it allowed me to see the art pieces in categories, and it felt quite intuitive. I liked that you could hover over the squares that represented the art pieces, and more information was provided. I was measuring how the art collection had changed over time, and this gave some insight. I realized that this graph was functional, but ultimately was too vague, and so I made a bar graph instead. The bar graph provided clear quantities.  It does this by adding numbers to the y-axis, instead of just categories.

            <h2>Expected Patterns and Outliers</h2>
            <p>I expected for there to be a steady increase of artwork over time. Most collections start relatively small and expand as funding and public interest grows. This is shown in the graph, but I was not expecting such a huge increase in the 1980s -1990s . This implies that there was a big change towards the collection. Most of the collection comprises of paintings, and sculptures, which is also to be expected of an art institution, but I found it interesting how quickly other mediums of art were added to the collection. An example of this is the decade of 1970 where print and photography are almost equally represented in the collection as paintings and sculptures. This is even more interesting when viewing the previous decade which only included paintings.

            <h2>Questions for further exploration</h2>
            <p>The main question I have is what happened in the decade leading up to the 1980s and 90s?
What specific events or problems during this time made it harder for the museum to acquire new art? Were there political or economic factors involved?

Why did the types of art being collected change? Was there a deliberate effort to focus on certain mediums or styles?

Did the museum change its strategy from buying many artworks to acquiring fewer, more significant pieces?

            <h2> Evaluation</h2>
           
<p>Overall, I think tableau was a good visualization tool, and it seemed pretty intuitive. Part of the reason I was able to use tableau so easily is because the .csv was also pretty well categorized, and the categories made sense when using tableau. I remembered most of the steps we did in the class tutorial and that speaks to how user-friendly this tool is.
